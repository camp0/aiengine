- Freebsd support for the aiengine binary (not the python wrapper).
- Support for Host names on SSL traffic.
- Support for banned domains and hosts for HTTP, DNS and SSL
- Support for sigusr1, sigusr2 on the aiengine binary for dump stats.

  Check redis_adaptor.py as a example on /examples

Features of 0.6
- Ip Filters for ip matching rules (unordered_set(ready), bloom filters(planned)).
- Minor bugs (leak on pcre).

Features of 0.8
- Counters for IP fragmentation packets.
- Support for TLS1.2 on the SSLProtocol
- Exposed the FrequencyGroup and the LearnerEngine on python.
- Expose a handler function on the PacketDispatcher for integrate with NetfilterPython or other packet systems.
- Support for python 3.x versions (check INSTALL).
- Sorts the outputs of the HTTP, SSL and DNS most used domains (aiengine binary).
- Support for HTTP1.1 (URI Cache), all the flows will have all the paths taken by the user.
- Shell support. The system have a interactive shell so the user can interact on realtime with the system.
